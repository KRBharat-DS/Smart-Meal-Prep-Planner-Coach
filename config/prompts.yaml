  2. For EACH day, provide distinct meal names for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
  3. Consider ALL aspects of the user profile provided above. Ensure the plan aligns with their fitness goal, respects all dietary restrictions, avoidances, and schedule constraints. Incorporate specific requests where possible.
  4. Adhere strictly to the schedule constraints (e.g., if 'dinner out Wednesday' is mentioned, list 'Dinner Out (User Specified)' for Wednesday dinner). If 'quick lunches' are needed, suggest meals generally known to be quick to prepare.
  5. Do NOT include recipes, ingredients, or cooking times in this basic plan. Only provide the meal names.
  6. Output the entire plan as a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON object. Do NOT use markdown formatting like ```json.

detailed_meal_plan_prompt: |
  You are an expert meal planning assistant. Your goal is to create a highly detailed, personalized 7-day meal plan based on the user's specific needs and preferences.

  **User Profile:**
  * Fitness Goal: {fitness_goal}
  * Dietary Preferences: {dietary_preferences}
  * Allergies/Avoidances: {allergies_or_avoidances}
  * Taste Preferences: {taste_preferences}
  * Schedule Constraints: {schedule_constraints}
  * Specific Requests: {specific_requests}

  **Instructions:**
  1. Generate a 7-day meal plan (Day 1 to Day 7).
  2. For EACH day, provide details for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
  3. For EACH meal, include the following fields:
      * `meal_name`: The name of the meal.
      * `ingredients`: A list of necessary ingredients (as strings). **Be concise.**
      * `recipe_steps`: A list of concise, easy-to-follow preparation steps (as strings). **Keep steps brief (e.g., 3-5 steps max per recipe).**
      * `prep_time_minutes`: Estimated preparation time in minutes (as an integer).
      * `cook_time_minutes`: Estimated cooking time in minutes (as an integer).
  4. Consider ALL aspects of the user profile. Ensure the plan aligns with their fitness goal, respects all dietary restrictions, avoidances, and schedule constraints. Incorporate specific requests where possible.
  5. Adhere strictly to schedule constraints (e.g., if 'dinner out Wednesday' is mentioned, the dinner object for that day should reflect this, perhaps with minimal details like `meal_name: "Dinner Out (User Specified)"` and null/zero/empty for other fields). If 'quick lunches' are needed, ensure lunch recipes have low total time.
  6. Ensure recipe steps are concise and clear. Ensure times are realistic estimates. **Prioritize brevity in descriptions.**
  7. Output the entire plan as a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON object. Do NOT use markdown formatting
  ```json
  {{
    "day_1": {{
      "breakfast": {{
        "meal_name": "Example Breakfast Name",
        "ingredients": ["Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", "etc."],
        "recipe_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "etc."],
        "prep_time_minutes": 5,
        "cook_time_minutes": 10,
        "swappable_suggestion": "Alternative Breakfast"
      }},
      "lunch": {{ ... meal details ... }},
      "dinner": {{ ... meal details ... }}
    }},
    "day_2": {{ ... daily plan ... }},
    // ... and so on for all 7 days ...
  }}
